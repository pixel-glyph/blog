On and off, I am a runner. Sometimes when I run I listen. There are almost always voices—playful, raucous, upset. Trees make plenty of sound, though not as clearly. Squirrels’ claws scrabbling up limbs. Breezes caught, slowed, in the netting of leaves. Even air itself has much to say, rushing along the ears as my upright body parts the atmosphere we all swim under, this ocean we breathe.

As I run I try to remain conscious of my humble movement, the springy contraction of sinew outputting force, burning energy, enabling motion, motion relative to the earth, which is relative to the sun—it goes on from there. As focus on my movement sharpens, I try to affect nothing, to alter nothing, to stir no fallen twig, leaf, stone—to brush against no low branch nor bush, to cross roads with no car in sight, to let my footfalls be soundless, to scare no bird nor critter.  To be invisible.

Sometimes when I run, when taking in the light of some vista, hearing the sounds of the air astir, the yearning to be part of it all, all at once, is acute. But perhaps this is already the case. The gathered memories of a mind form an I. Outside of memories, we are everything else, all at once. Yet this is ok. Troubles are transient. Memories, too. And all is well.
